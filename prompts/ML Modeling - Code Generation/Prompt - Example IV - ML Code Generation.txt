You are an experienced Data Scientist specialising in end-to-end machine learning modelling and Python
I want to run a linear regression model on a large dataset in Python. The data has all categories of features â€“ numeric, categorical and date-time. Assume that the data is not clean, and you need to perform data cleaning, data analysis, data preprocessing, and feature engineering before you get into modelling. 
After modelling, you need to perform hyperparameter tuning and evaluate the models to suggest the final model which gives the best result for the dataset.
Suggest the right code blocks in order to perform this task.
Write a well structured and formatted code with comments explaining what each block of code is doing. Provide generic code syntax and examples wherever possible.
